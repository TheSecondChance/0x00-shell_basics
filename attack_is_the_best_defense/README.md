#Network Sniffer
----------------  
Network sniffers take snapshot copies of the data flowing over a network without redirecting or altering it.  
Some sniffers work only with TCP/IP packets, but the more sophisticated tools work  
with many other network protocols and at lower levels, including Ethernet frames.
