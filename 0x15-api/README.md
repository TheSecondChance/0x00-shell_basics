API:
	stands for Application Programming Interface. It is a set of rules and protocols that allows different
	software applications to communicate with each other. APIs define how different software components
	should interact, making it possible for developers to use predefined functions or request specific
	services from an external application, service, or platform.

	APIs are commonly used to enable the integration of different software systems, allowing them
	to work together and share data or functionalities. They serve as a bridge between different
	applications, enabling developers to leverage the features of existing software without having
	to understand its internal workings.

	APIs can be found in various contexts, including web development, mobile app development,
	operating systems, and cloud computing. They play a crucial role in facilitating interoperability
	and collaboration in the software development ecosystem
